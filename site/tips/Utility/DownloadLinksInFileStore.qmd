[Filestore is not actively recommended and considered legacy by Databricks](https://docs.databricks.com/en/archive/legacy/filestore.html#filestore)

### Summary
- Databricks FileStore allows you to store files that are accessible via download links 
- You can programmatically generate download URLs for files in FileStore
- While FileStore works, using external cloud storage like Azure Blob Storage or AWS S3 is generally recommended for file sharing

### Detail

Databricks FileStore provides a convenient way to store files that you want to make available for download. By copying files into the special `/FileStore` directory in DBFS, you can easily generate URLs that allow users to download those files directly from rendered notebooks.

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
This code snippet assumes you have already generated a file, like an Excel spreadsheet, and saved it to a temporary location like `/tmp`. Adjust the code based on your specific use case.
:::

Here's how you can create a download link for a file using FileStore in a Python notebook:

```python
# File paths
temp_file_path = "/tmp/output_data.xlsx"
filestore_path = "/FileStore/output_data.xlsx"

# Code to generate the Excel file and save to temp_file_path 
# goes here...

# Copy the file from temp directory to FileStore
dbutils.fs.cp(f"file:{temp_file_path}", filestore_path)

# Get the URL parameters 
workspace_url = spark.conf.get("spark.databricks.workspaceUrl")

# Generate the download URL
download_url = f"https://{workspace_url}/files/output_data.xlsx"

# Render the download link using displayHTML
displayHTML(f"<a href='{download_url}'>Click here to download the Excel file</a>")
```



The key steps are:

1. Copy the file into FileStore using `dbutils.fs.cp` 
2. Retrieve the workspace URL from the Spark context
3. Construct the download URL 
4. Render the download link using `displayHTML`

When a user clicks the rendered download link, it will prompt their browser to download the file directly from FileStore.
