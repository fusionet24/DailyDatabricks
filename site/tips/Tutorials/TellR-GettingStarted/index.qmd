-   You'll install TellR, connect it to the **Bakehouse** sample dataset in Unity Catalog, and create your first presentation
-   TellR queries your data through **Genie spaces**, respecting Unity Catalog permissions automatically
-   Slides are rendered as interactive HTML with **Chart.js** visualizations
-   You can refine slides conversationally — no need to start over

## What is TellR?

[TellR](https://github.com/robertwhiffin/ai-slide-generator) is an agentic application that generates presentation-ready slides from enterprise data through conversational interaction. It runs as a Databricks App and integrates with Genie spaces to query live, governed data.

Key features:

-   **Conversational slide creation** — Describe what you want in plain English and TellR builds the deck
-   **Genie integration** — Queries your data through Genie spaces, so your slides reflect real, up-to-date numbers
-   **Unity Catalog security** — All data access respects your existing permissions; no data leaks outside governance boundaries
-   **Interactive visualizations** — Generates Chart.js-based charts that are interactive in the browser
-   **Iterative editing** — Refine slides with follow-up prompts like "add a Q3 comparison" or "change the chart to a bar graph"
-   **Prompt-only mode** — Works without Genie for general-purpose presentations

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

-   A **Databricks workspace** with Apps enabled
-   Permission to **create a Lakebase** (or an existing schema you can use)
-   Access to the **Bakehouse sample dataset** in Unity Catalog (available by default in most workspaces)
-   A **Genie space** (we'll create one in Step 2) or willingness to use prompt-only mode

## The Bakehouse Dataset

The Bakehouse dataset is a sample dataset available in Unity Catalog. It models a bakery franchise business with sales, customers, suppliers, and reviews.

| Table                        | Description                              |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `sales_transactions`         | Fact table with individual sales records |
| `sales_customers`            | Customer dimension table                 |
| `sales_franchises`           | Franchise/store location details         |
| `sales_suppliers`            | Product supplier information             |
| `media_customer_reviews`     | Customer feedback and ratings            |
| `media_gold_reviews_chunked` | Processed review data for analytics      |

::: {.callout-tip title="Finding the Dataset" appearance="simple"}
In your Databricks workspace, navigate to the **Catalog Explorer** and look under `samples` \> `bakehouse`. If you don't see it, your workspace administrator may need to enable sample datasets.
:::

Let's explore the tables to get familiar with the data:

```{python}
# Browse the bakehouse schema
spark.sql("SHOW TABLES IN samples.bakehouse").show()
```

```{python}
# Preview the sales transactions
spark.table("samples.bakehouse.sales_transactions").limit(10).show()
```

```{python}
# Check the schema
spark.table("samples.bakehouse.sales_transactions").printSchema()
```

## Step 1: Install TellR

Open a new notebook in your Databricks workspace and run the following cells:

``` python
%pip install --upgrade databricks-tellr databricks-sdk==0.73.0
dbutils.library.restartPython()
```

Then create the TellR app:

``` python
import databricks_tellr as tellr

tellr.create(
    lakebase_name="tellr-db",
    schema_name="app_data",
    app_name="tellr",
    app_file_workspace_path="/Workspace/Users/you@example.com/.apps/tellr"
)
```

::: {.callout-note title="Workspace Path" appearance="simple"}
Replace `you@example.com` with your actual Databricks username. This is the workspace path where TellR's application files will be stored.
:::

::: {.callout-warning title="Deployment Error: Token Passthrough Not Enabled" collapse="true"}
You may encounter this error during deployment:

```
Deployment failed: Databricks Apps - user token passthrough feature
is not enabled for organization <org_id>.
Config: host=<workspace_url>, auth_type=runtime
```

This means **On Behalf Of (OBO) authentication** is not enabled for your workspace. Databricks Apps require this feature so the app can act on behalf of the logged-in user when accessing data through Unity Catalog.

To resolve this, a workspace administrator needs to enable the **On Behalf Of auth** setting for Databricks Apps. See the screenshot below for where to find this in the admin console.

## Step 2: Create a Genie Space

TellR uses Genie spaces to query your data with natural language. To set one up for the Bakehouse dataset:

1.  In your Databricks workspace, go to **Genie** in the left sidebar
2.  Click **New Genie space**
3.  Give it a name like "Bakehouse Analytics"
4.  Add the Bakehouse tables you want TellR to query:
    -   `samples.bakehouse.sales_transactions`
    -   `samples.bakehouse.sales_customers`
    -   `samples.bakehouse.sales_franchises`
    -   `samples.bakehouse.sales_suppliers`
    -   `samples.bakehouse.media_customer_reviews`
5.  Add a description to help Genie understand the data context, for example: "Sales and customer data for a bakery franchise business. Includes transactions, customer details, franchise locations, suppliers, and customer reviews."
6.  Save the Genie space

![Creating a Genie space for the Bakehouse dataset](Assets/genie-space-setup.png)

::: {.callout-tip title="Genie Space Tips" appearance="simple"}
The more descriptive your Genie space instructions are, the better TellR will understand your data. Include details about relationships between tables and common business questions.
:::

## Step 3: Launch the App

Once TellR is installed and your Genie space is ready:

1.  Navigate to **Apps** in the left sidebar of your Databricks workspace
2.  Find and open the **tellr** app
3.  The TellR interface will load in your browser

![TellR app running in Databricks](Assets/tellr-app-launch.png)

## Step 4: Generate Your First Slide Deck

Now for the fun part. In TellR's chat interface, describe the presentation you want. Here are some prompts to try with the Bakehouse dataset:

**Start with a simple request:**

> Create a presentation showing total sales by franchise location

**Add more slides:**

> Add a slide comparing customer review ratings across franchises

**Get more specific:**

> Add a slide showing monthly sales trends for the top 3 franchises over the last year

**Refine existing slides:**

> Change the sales trend chart to use a line graph instead of bars

![TellR generating slides from the Bakehouse dataset](Assets/tellr-slides-generated.png)

TellR will query your Genie space for the data, generate insights, and produce an interactive slide deck. Each slide can include:

-   Data-driven text summaries
-   Interactive Chart.js visualizations
-   Tables with key metrics

## Tips & Tricks

::: {.callout-tip title="Prompt-Only Mode" appearance="simple"}
If you don't have a Genie space set up, TellR can still generate slides from descriptive prompts. It won't pull live data, but it's useful for creating general-purpose presentations quickly.
:::

::: {.callout-tip title="Iterative Refinement" appearance="simple"}
You don't need to get your prompts perfect the first time. TellR supports conversational editing — ask it to change colours, swap chart types, add comparisons, or restructure the narrative. Think of it like chatting with a presentation designer.
:::

::: {.callout-tip title="Export Your Slides" appearance="simple"}
TellR generates HTML slides, which means they're easy to share via a link or embed in other tools. You can also screenshot or print to PDF for traditional distribution.
:::

::: {.callout-note title="Unity Catalog Permissions" appearance="simple"}
TellR respects your Unity Catalog permissions. If you can't see certain data in the Catalog Explorer, TellR won't be able to query it either. This means your presentations are always within your governance boundaries.
:::

## Cleanup & Cost Management

::: {.callout-important title="Stop Resources to Avoid Costs" appearance="simple"}
Once you're finished with this tutorial, make sure you stop the following resources to avoid incurring unnecessary costs:

1. **Stop the Lakebase** — Navigate to **SQL Warehouses** in your workspace and stop the Lakebase database (`tellr-db`) that was created during installation
2. **Stop the Databricks App** — Go to **Apps**, find the **tellr** app, and stop it
3. **Stop the Genie data warehouse** — The Genie space uses an attached SQL warehouse; make sure it is stopped as well

You should also consider **deleting the Genie space** you created if you no longer need it, as an active Genie space with an attached warehouse can continue to incur compute costs.
