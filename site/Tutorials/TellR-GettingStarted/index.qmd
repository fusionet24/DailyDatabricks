## What is TellR?

[TellR](https://github.com/robertwhiffin/ai-slide-generator) is an agentic application that generates presentation-ready slides from enterprise data through conversational interaction. It runs as a Databricks App and integrates with Genie spaces to query live, governed data.

Key features:

-   **Conversational slide creation** — Describe what you want in plain English and TellR builds the deck
-   **Genie integration** — Queries your data through Genie spaces, so your slides reflect real, up-to-date numbers
-   **Unity Catalog security** — All data access respects your existing permissions; no data leaks outside governance boundaries
-   **Interactive visualizations** — Generates Chart.js-based charts that are interactive in the browser
-   **Custom slide styles** — Define your own branding with colours, typography, and layout rules
-   **Profiles** — Bundle a Genie space, slide style, and deck prompt into a reusable configuration
-   **Iterative editing** — Refine slides with follow-up prompts like "add a Q3 comparison" or "change the chart to a bar graph"

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

-   A **Databricks workspace** with Apps enabled
-   Permission to **create a Lakebase** (or an existing schema you can use)
-   Access to the **Bakehouse sample dataset** in Unity Catalog (available by default in most workspaces)
-   **On Behalf Of (OBO) authentication** enabled for Databricks Apps (see Step 1 for details)

## The Bakehouse Dataset

The Bakehouse dataset is a sample dataset available in Unity Catalog. It models a bakery franchise business with sales, customers, suppliers, and reviews.

| Table                        | Description                              |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `sales_transactions`         | Fact table with individual sales records |
| `sales_customers`            | Customer dimension table                 |
| `sales_franchises`           | Franchise/store location details         |
| `sales_suppliers`            | Product supplier information             |
| `media_customer_reviews`     | Customer feedback and ratings            |
| `media_gold_reviews_chunked` | Processed review data for analytics      |

::: {.callout-tip title="Finding the Dataset" appearance="simple"}
In your Databricks workspace, navigate to the **Catalog Explorer** and look under `samples` \> `bakehouse`. If you don't see it, your workspace administrator may need to enable sample datasets.
:::

Let's explore the tables to get familiar with the data:

```{python}
# Browse the bakehouse schema
spark.sql("SHOW TABLES IN samples.bakehouse").show()
```

```{python}
# Preview the sales transactions
spark.table("samples.bakehouse.sales_transactions").limit(10).show()
```

```{python}
# Check the schema
spark.table("samples.bakehouse.sales_transactions").printSchema()
```

## Step 1: Install TellR

Open a new notebook in your Databricks workspace and run the following cells:

``` python
%pip install --upgrade databricks-tellr databricks-sdk==0.73.0
dbutils.library.restartPython()
```

Then create the TellR app:

``` python
import databricks_tellr as tellr

tellr.create(
    lakebase_name="tellr-db",
    schema_name="app_data",
    app_name="tellr",
    app_file_workspace_path="/Workspace/Users/you@example.com/.apps/tellr"
)
```

::: {.callout-note title="Workspace Path" appearance="simple"}
Replace `you@example.com` with your actual Databricks username. This is the workspace path where TellR's application files will be stored.
:::

::: {.callout-warning title="Deployment Error: Token Passthrough Not Enabled" collapse="true"}
You may encounter this error during deployment:

```         
Deployment failed: Databricks Apps - user token passthrough feature
is not enabled for organization <org_id>.
Config: host=<workspace_url>, auth_type=runtime
```

This means **On Behalf Of (OBO) authentication** is not enabled for your workspace. Databricks Apps require this feature so the app can act on behalf of the logged-in user when accessing data through Unity Catalog.

To resolve this, a workspace administrator needs to enable the **On Behalf Of auth** setting for Databricks Apps. See the screenshot below for where to find this in the admin console.

![Enabling On Behalf Of authentication for Databricks Apps](Assets/ENable%20On%20Behalf%20of.png)
:::

![Installing TellR in a Databricks notebook](Assets/DatabricksTellRNotebookSetup.png)

## Step 2: Verify the Lakebase

After installation completes, TellR creates a **Lakebase** (a managed PostgreSQL database) to store its application data. You can verify it was created successfully by navigating to **SQL Warehouses** in your workspace and checking for the `tellr-db` instance.

![The tellr-db Lakebase is created and available](Assets/LakebaseDatabaseIsCreated.png)

The Lakebase should show a status of **Available** with PostgreSQL version 16. This is where TellR stores profiles, slide styles, history, and other app configuration.

## Step 3: Authorize the App

When you first open TellR, you'll be prompted to authorize the app to act on your behalf. This is the **On Behalf Of (OBO)** authentication flow — TellR needs permission to read Unity Catalog tables and manage model serving endpoints under your identity.

![Permission request when first opening TellR](Assets/give%20permissions%20on%20app.png)

Review the requested permissions:

-   **Read Unity Catalog tables** — so TellR can query your data through Genie spaces
-   **Read Unity Catalog schemas** and **catalogs** — for data discovery
-   **Manage your model serving endpoints** — TellR uses a Foundation Model endpoint for slide generation

Click **Authorize** to proceed.

## Step 4: Explore TellR

Once authorized, you'll land on the TellR help page. This gives you an overview of the app's features and navigation.

![TellR landing page](Assets/tellr-landing-page.png)

The top navigation bar provides access to:

-   **Generator** — The main chat interface for creating slides
-   **History** — Previously generated slide decks
-   **Profiles** — Configuration profiles that bundle data sources, styles, and prompts
-   **Deck Prompts** — Pre-built prompt templates for specific presentation types
-   **Slide Styles** — Visual styling rules for slide generation
-   **Help** — The overview page you're looking at

Before we can generate slides, we need to set up three things: a **Genie space** for our data, a **custom slide style**, and a **profile** that ties them together.

## Step 5: Create a Genie Space

TellR queries your data through Genie spaces. We need to create one for the Bakehouse dataset.

1.  In your Databricks workspace, go to **Genie** in the left sidebar
2.  Click **New Genie space**
3.  In the **Connect your data** dialog, navigate to `All catalogs` \> `samples` \> `bakehouse`

![Navigating to the Bakehouse schema in the Genie space creator](Assets/create_genie_space.png)

4.  Select the tables you want TellR to query. For this tutorial, select `sales_transactions`, `sales_suppliers`, and `sales_customers`:

![Selecting Bakehouse tables for the Genie space](Assets/createGenieSpace.png)

5.  Click **Create** to save the Genie space

::: {.callout-tip title="Genie Space Tips" appearance="simple"}
The more descriptive your Genie space instructions are, the better TellR will understand your data. You can add a description like: *"Sales and customer data for a bakery franchise business. Includes transactions, customer details, and supplier information."*
:::

## Step 6: Create a Custom Slide Style

Before creating a profile, let's set up a custom slide style. TellR comes with a **System Default** style, but you can create your own to match your branding.

1.  In TellR, click **Slide Styles** in the top navigation
2.  Click **+ Create Style**
3.  Give it a name — we'll use **DailyDatabricks** for this example
4.  Define the style content with your brand colours, typography, spacing, and chart palette

![Creating a custom DailyDatabricks slide style](Assets/creating_styles.png)

The style content is a text-based specification that controls typography, colours, layout, spacing, and data visualisation palettes. TellR's AI uses this to generate slides that match your brand identity.

## Step 7: Create a Profile

A **profile** bundles together a Genie space, slide style, and deck prompt into a reusable configuration. The profile creation wizard walks you through five steps.

### Step 7.1: Basic Info

Click **Profiles** in the top navigation, then **+ Create Profile**. Give your profile a name — we'll call ours **BakeHouse**.

![Step 1: Enter profile name and description](Assets/createBakehouse.png)

### Step 7.2: Select Genie Space

Choose the Genie space you created in Step 5. This tells TellR where to pull data from when generating slides.

![Step 2: Select the Genie space for your profile](Assets/create_profile_bakehouse_secltion.png)

::: {.callout-tip title="Data Description" appearance="simple"}
Fill in the **Data Description (for AI Agent)** field to give TellR's AI context about what your data represents. This helps it generate more relevant slide narratives.
:::

### Step 7.3: Select Slide Style

Choose the **DailyDatabricks** style we created in Step 6. This controls the visual appearance of generated slides.

![Step 3: Select the DailyDatabricks slide style](Assets/create%20profile%20style%20selector.png)

### Step 7.4: Select Deck Prompt

Choose a deck prompt template that matches the type of presentation you want to create. For this example, we'll select **Quarterly Business Review** which structures the deck around performance metrics, achievements, challenges, and strategic recommendations.

![Step 4: Select a deck prompt template](Assets/create%20profile%20deck%20prompt.png)

### Step 7.5: Review and Save

Review your profile settings and save. You can always come back to edit these later.

## Step 8: Review Your Profile

After creation, you can view your profile details at any time by clicking on it in the Profiles tab. This shows the complete configuration at a glance.

![Viewing the BakeHouse profile configuration](Assets/View%20Profile%20Information.png)

Notice the profile shows:

-   **Genie Space** — linked to the Bakehouse data
-   **Slide Style** — DailyDatabricks
-   **Deck Prompt** — Quarterly Business Review
-   **AI Infrastructure** — the Foundation Model endpoint being used (in this case, `databricks-claude-sonnet-4-5` with temperature 0.7)

::: {.callout-tip title="Editing a Profile" appearance="simple"}
Click the **Edit** button at the top of the profile view to modify any setting. You can change the Genie space, swap styles, or switch deck prompts without creating a new profile.
:::

## Step 9: Generate Your Slides

Now for the main event. Make sure your **BakeHouse** profile is selected in the top-right dropdown, then navigate to the **Generator** tab.

Type a prompt describing the presentation you want. For example:

> Generate the slides to help me understand the current state of the art and our position for the next FY. We need to think prescriptive.

TellR will begin querying your Genie space and generating slides. You can watch the process in the chat panel — it makes multiple calls to `query_genie_space` to gather the data it needs.

![TellR generating slides from Bakehouse data via Genie queries](Assets/generator%20of%20slides.png)

After a few moments, the slides appear in the preview panel on the right. You can select individual slides, review the generated content, and continue the conversation to refine them.

![The generated FY2025 Strategic Position Review presentation](Assets/first%20attemp%20.png)

The generated deck includes:

-   A title slide with your branding
-   Executive summary with key metrics
-   Data visualisations pulled directly from Bakehouse
-   Strategic analysis and recommendations

::: {.callout-tip title="Iterative Refinement" appearance="simple"}
You don't need to get your prompt perfect the first time. TellR supports conversational editing — ask it to change colours, swap chart types, add comparisons, or restructure the narrative. Think of it like chatting with a presentation designer.
:::
::: {.callout-tip title="Verify Your Genie Space Queries" appearance="simple"}
You can check the actual queries to your Genie space directly by clicking the database link on a slide that will take you to the Databricks UI. This helps validate and verify the AI generated queries being used in TellR.

## Step 10: Export and Share

TellR provides two export options via the **Export** button in the top-right of the slide preview:

-   **HTML** — An interactive, self-contained HTML file with live Chart.js visualizations
-   **PDF** — A static document for traditional distribution

::: {.callout-tip title="Example Output" appearance="simple"}
Here's the actual HTML slide deck generated from the Bakehouse dataset in this tutorial. You can scroll through and interact with the charts:

<iframe src="Assets/fy2025-strategic-position-review.html" style="width: 1280px; height: 760px; zoom: 0.55; border: 1px solid #ddd; border-radius: 8px;"></iframe>

You can also download the [PDF version](Assets/FY2025%20Strategic%20Position%20Review_2026-01-31T23-01-49.pdf) of this presentation.

## Tips & Tricks

::: {.callout-tip title="Prompt-Only Mode" appearance="simple"}
If you don't have a Genie space set up, TellR can still generate slides from descriptive prompts. Skip the Genie space step in the profile wizard to create a prompt-only profile. It won't pull live data, but it's useful for creating general-purpose presentations quickly.
:::

::: {.callout-tip title="Multiple Profiles" appearance="simple"}
Create different profiles for different use cases — one for executive reviews, another for team updates, another for customer-facing decks. Each can have its own Genie space, style, and deck prompt.
:::

::: {.callout-note title="Unity Catalog Permissions" appearance="simple"}
TellR respects your Unity Catalog permissions. If you can't see certain data in the Catalog Explorer, TellR won't be able to query it either. This means your presentations are always within your governance boundaries.
:::

## Cleanup & Cost Management

::: {.callout-important title="Stop Resources to Avoid Costs" appearance="simple"}
Once you're finished with this tutorial, make sure you stop the following resources to avoid incurring unnecessary costs:

1.  **Stop the Lakebase** — Navigate to **SQL Warehouses** in your workspace and stop the Lakebase database (`tellr-db`) that was created during installation
2.  **Stop the Databricks App** — Go to **Apps**, find the **tellr** app, and stop it
3.  **Stop the Genie data warehouse** — The Genie space uses an attached SQL warehouse; make sure it is stopped as well

You should also consider **deleting the Genie space** you created if you no longer need it, as an active Genie space with an attached warehouse can continue to incur compute costs.
